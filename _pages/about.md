Short Bio
======
I am a Ph.D. student from [TAMS group](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de), Informatics Department, Universität Hamburg.

My research interests are about the intersection of robotics and AI. In my opinion, AI-based methods are taking over the robotics research recent years, but they are not skeleton keys to all of the problems. I wish to bridge the model-based methods(MPC, RRT, Inverse optimal control etc.) and data-driven methods(Reinforcement learning, Inverse Reinforcement learning, imitation learning etc.) together. So my concrete research topics include data-driven prediction methods, optimization-based trajectory planning, and reinforcement learning, aiming to make the robot behavior reactive and also predictive to the environment.
